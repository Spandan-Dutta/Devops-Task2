# DevOps methods
There are a few common DevOps methods that organizations can use to speed and improve development and product releases. They take the form of software development methodologies and practices. Among the most popular ones are Scrum, Kanban, and Agile:

Scrum. Scrum defines how members of a team should work together to accelerate development and QA projects. Scrum practices include key workflows and specific terminology (sprints, time boxes, daily scrum [meeting]), and designated roles (Scrum Master, product owner).
Kanban. Kanban originated from efficiencies gained on the Toyota factory floor. Kanban prescribes that the state of software project work in progress (WIP) be tracked on a Kanban board.
Agile. Earlier agile software development methods continue to heavily influence DevOps practices and tools. Many DevOps methods, including Scrum and Kanban, incorporate elements of agile programming. Some agile practices are associated with greater responsiveness to changing needs and requirements, documenting requirements as user stories, performing daily standups, and incorporating continuous customer feedback. Agile also prescribes shorter software development lifecycles instead of lengthy, traditional “waterfall” development methods.
